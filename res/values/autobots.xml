Rules and Specifications

GAME RULES:

1. The maximum time given for completing the task is 4 minutes.

2. The operator of Manual robot cannot be changed during the match.

3. Mangalyaan is allowed to move only in the Galaxy at all times.

4. Manual robot is allowed to move only in the Manual zone

5. If suppose the Manual robot drops the key/Satellites/Gx/Px, it has to go back to the respective collection Zone and pick another one.

6. In case of wired Manual robot, the wire must be slack at any point of time during the game. The total length of wire extending from the remote control to the Manual robot must be of minimum 2 meters.

7.After starting the Mangalyaan, the team member who performs the starting action must leave the game field immediately.

8. Mangalyaan cannot enter the arena of the opponent’s team.

RESTARTS:

1. If suppose the Mangalyaan drops satellites, the Mangalyaan has to restart again.

2. In case of restart, the timer will not be set back to zero and time will not be paused.

3. During restarts for the Mangalyaan, a contestant cannot feed any information to it. However, contestants are allowed to adjust sensors (gain, position etc.) and make minor repairs. A contestant may not alter it in a manner that alters its weight. (e.g. removal of a bulky sensor array or switching to lighter batteries to get better speed).

4. All restarts for Mangalyaan require the approval of the organizers before it can be removed from the arena. If it were handled within the arena without approval, it will be considered as violation.

GENERAL RULES:

1. Team members will not be allowed to handle the key/satellites/Gx/Px. Only organizers are allowed to handle the satellites/Gx/Px in any situation. If the key/satellites/Gx/Px were handled within the arena without the approval of the presiding organizers,it will be considered as violation.

2. The Mangalyaan is not allowed to leave anything behind while traversing the grid. It should not make any marks on the floor of the arena. Any Robot found damaging the arena will be immediately disqualified.

3. Only two members of the team are allowed to handle the Robots. Participants are not allowed to keep anything inside the arena other than the Manual and Mangalyaan. After the Mangalyaan starts, the team members are not allowed to touch the Mangalyaan.

4. Laptops/personal computers are not allowed near the arena. Other Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc. devices must be switched off. The organizers hold the right to check for these devices and their usage and disqualify the team.

5.The organizers may stop any Robot at any time if they feel that it is performing or is about to perform any action that is dangerous or hazardous to people or equipment. No Robot is allowed to use any flammable, combustible, explosive or potentially dangerous processes.

6.The time measured by the organizers will be final and will be used for scoring the teams. Time measured by any contestant by any other means is not acceptable for scoring.

7.In case of any disputes/discrepancies, the organizer’s decision will be final and binding. The organizers reserve the rights to change any or all of the above rules as they deem fit. Change in rules, if any will be highlighted on the website and notified to the registered teams.

8.If there is a tie then the team depositing the key first will be considered as a winner.

Safety for the Robots:-

1. All Robots must be designed and manufactured as to pose no danger of any kind to any person in the venue.

2. All Robots must be designed and manufactured as to cause no damage to any Robots of the opposing team or to the game field.

3. Combustible-fuel-driven engines, explosives, high-pressure pneumatics (e.g. 1 mega Pascal), power-generating chemicals, and undamped spring actuators (which make an action less than half second) are all prohibited, for motion propulsion or expansion of Robot’s size.

4. If a laser emitting device is used, it must be of class 2 or less. In deploying the laser, full care must be taken to protect all persons at the venue from harm during all procedures. In particular, the laser beams must be so oriented that the beam will not be aimed sloping upwards, or horizontally to hit the eyes of sitting spectators.Robot

Set Up:-

1 .One Manual robot, one Mangalyaan are required for each team.

2 .One minute is given for setting of Robots before the game starts.

3. Only the two members of each team, including the Manual robot Operator, can engage in the setting up of Robots. Any team that fails to complete setting of the Robots within one minute can resume the setting process once the game starts.
